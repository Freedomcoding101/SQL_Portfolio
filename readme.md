    My first SQL-Alchemy Portfolio project!

    #Description
    This is my portfolio using flask and SQL Alchemy. It is a website built on a development server that has information on all of my projects
    and links to my github. It showcases my knowledge of Flask, SQL Alchemy, basic CSS and HTML and python. Basically it compiles all of my projects in one place to showcase my knowledge in all of these areas. 

    #Directions on how to run the program locally..
    To run the program locally you will need to type python app.py into the console. This will start the development server and then when you CTRL and click the link it will open the project inside of your web browser. From here it will interact as a website does and all links will bring you to the places intended. You will be able to create new projects, edit and delete them and this will either add or remove them from the database!

    #What have I learned?
    From this I have learned about routes, and how to use Flask/SQL Alchemy and python to make HTML and CSS more organized and easier to manipulate. By using a template you can quickly and easily build out a website by quickly importing the contents that repeat on a web page and then leaving a space for the content that changes. You can import variables and other code to your page and determine what type of information is coming in from a form and WHERE to save it inside of a database. When the information has been saved into a database it can then be read and the website updates with the new information inputted, all while following all of the rules laid out in front of it to form a fully functioning website that updates as the user interacts with it.
